1. Loop through each of our specified currencies
2. Calculate the lookback length based on the volatility(higher volatility, higher lookback length)
    volatility will be based on the standard deviation (use numpy)
3. The highest price in the history of the lookback is the breakout level
4. If in breakout range and not in position -> buy
5. else if not in breakout range -> do nothing
6. For each position, set a trailing stop-loss order with a specified percentage of loss (i.e. 10 % )
7. Track price of currency
8. Compare current price with last stored price
9. If price goes up -> hodl and update stored price
10. else if price goes down, then check percentage loss
11. if percentage loss >= stop-loss -> sell
else hodl!!
12. Rinse and repeat
